# Payment_Application
for EgFWD Embedded Systems Professional Nanodegree Program

# Brief:
Payment systems are everywhere, and we use them daily. They handle different types of transactions:
- SALE: Buying something and paying from your bank account.
- REFUND: Returning an item and getting your money back.
- Pre-Authorization: Temporarily holding money for things like hotel reservations.
- VOID: Canceling a transaction, like when a seller makes a mistake.
I've implemented the SALE transaction, simulating the card, ATM terminal, and server.
